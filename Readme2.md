1.	key thing: Utilizing the LangChain library as a framework for customer design in fisheries-related chat applications.

2.	Incorporating the Google Generative API by leveraging its service via an API key. The primary objective is to enhance LangChainâ€™s capabilities by integrating Google Generative AI to produce high-quality conversational responses.

3.	Extracting text from a list of PDF documents (as per your instructions, Professor), with detailed explanations provided below.

4.	# PDF Text Extraction

This script extracts text from a list of PDF documents.

## Steps:

1. **Input**:
    - This function takes a list of PDF documents as input.
    - Each PDF document is processed as "a long string."

2. **Text Extraction**:
    - The script uses the `PdfReader` library to read each PDF file in the list.
    - The `extract_text()` function extracts text from each page, iterating through all pages.

3. **Text Concatenation**:
    - Extracted text from all pages across all PDFs is concatenated into a single string.

4. **Output**:
    - Returns the combined text from all pages in the PDF documents.
## Additional Functions:

5. **Function: `get_text_chunks`**  
   - Splits a large text into smaller, manageable chunks.

6. **Function: `get_conversational_chain()`**  
   - Uses a conversational AI chain (e.g., LangChain).  
   - Key considerations:  
     - Quality of context  
     - LLM parameters  
     - Prompt customization

7. **Workflow**:  
   - Create a pipeline using the `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` model.  
   - Customizable parameters:  
     - Model parameters  
     - Prompt style  
     - Chain type  

8. **Streamlit Integration**:  
   - Define a `main()` function to build a Streamlit app.  
   - Allows users to upload PDF files and interact with their content via questions (like ChatGPT).
